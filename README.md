## Boston Housing Price Prediction With PyTorch Neural Network

### Task
Build, train, and evaluate neural network models using PyTorch to predict Boston housing prices.

### Approach
1. **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant features for predicting housing prices.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Conduct any necessary feature transformations or creations.

3. **Standard ML Preprocessing**: Performing standard preprocessing steps such as MinMax Scaling for the dataset.

4. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Defining Neural Network Architecture**: Design the neural network architecture using PyTorch.

6. **Defining Training Loop**: Set up the training loop for the model.

7. **Training the Model**: Train the neural network on the training data.

8. **Experimenting with Hyperparameters**: Experiment with  5 different variations of hyperparameters including number of layers/neurons, activation functions, epochs, optimizers, and learning rates.

9. **Evaluating the Final Model**: Evaluate the final model on the test data to assess its performance.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which is available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices/data
