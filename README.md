## Boston Housing Price Prediction With PyTorch Neural Network

### Task
Build, train, and evaluate neural network models using PyTorch to predict Boston housing prices.

### Approach
*Feature Selection*: Identify relevant features for predicting housing prices.
*Feature Engineering*: Conduct any necessary feature transformations or creations.
*Standard ML Preprocessing*: Perform standard preprocessing steps such as scaling or normalization if required.
*Train-Test Split*: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
*Defining Neural Network Architecture*: Design the neural network architecture using PyTorch.
*Defining Training Loop*: Set up the training loop for the model.
*Training the Model*: Train the neural network on the training data.
*Experimenting with Hyperparameters*: Experiment with at least 5 different variations of hyperparameters including number of layers/neurons, activation functions, epochs, optimizers, and learning rates.
*Evaluating the Final Model*: Evaluate the final model on the test data to assess its performance.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which is available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices/data
